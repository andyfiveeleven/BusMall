As a bored bus rider, i want to be able to find products based on my interests and likes, but i can't hold attention too well, so i want a managagle list of things to choose from.

as the marketing manager for this product, i want to be able to track user interests so we can provide better and better products.

as a marketing analyst, i want to get hard data back on 25 choices, knowing the percentage of times a user clicked a choice when it was displayed.

as a developer, i want to create DRY code that is easy to read and delivers on the marketing team's needs.
